    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the ingredients of the Buttermilk Marinade into a bowl. 
            <br>Add the chicken legs and marinate at room temp for 30mins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 450F (230C). 
            <br>Line a rimmed baking pan with foil and place in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the Coating into a large ziplock bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the chicken legs from the buttermilk, drain, and dip 
            <br>the legs one at a time into the dry coating mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pan from the oven with pot holders and add 1 tablespoon melted butter to the pan.
            <br>With a pastry brush, spread melted butter all over the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Lay coated chicken legs into the pan. 
            <br>Pour half of the melted butter over the chicken legs.
        </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices
            <br>run clear, about 40 mins, turning over at the halfway point. 
            <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165F (74C).
            <br>Drizzle with remaining melted butter and serve immeadiately.
        </li>
    </ol>
